This repository contains the result of the paper "Novel cluster-algebraic letters for 5- and 6-point QCD processes" by Rigers Aliaj, Gabriele Dian and Georgios Papathanasiou in Wolfram Mathematica Language.

"Alphabet Reduction" contains the results of the DCI reduction procedure.

"6pt" involves the results of 6 point 1 mass and 6 point 1 massless letters, while 5pt2M the ones for 5 point 2 mass ones.
